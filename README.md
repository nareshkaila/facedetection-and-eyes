# facedetection-and-eyes


His project uses Streamlit to build an interactive web app that performs face detection in images or real-time video streams. It uses OpenCV and Haar cascades for detecting faces and displays the results in an easy-to-use interface. You can upload images, capture live video, and see face detection results in real-time.

Features
Real-time face detection on webcam video feed.
Face detection on image uploads.
Bounding boxes around detected faces.
Simple and user-friendly web interface using Streamlit.
Technologies Used
Python – Programming language.
Streamlit – Framework for building interactive web applications.
OpenCV – Library for computer vision tasks.
NumPy – For numerical operations.
